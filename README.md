This is an implementation in Play of a number of tools to build a Read-Write-Web server using Play2.x and akka.
It is very early stages at present and it implements sketches of the following

* A [CORS](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) proxy
* An initial implementation of [Linked Data Basic Profile](http://www.w3.org/2012/ldp/wiki/Main_Page)

This currently works in the [2.3.x-TLS branch of the fork of Play 2.x](https://github.com/read-write-web/Play20), which comes with TLS support and a few more patches.

We use [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org/) to verify the build: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/read-write-web/rww-play.png)](http://travis-ci.org/read-write-web/rww-play)

Getting going
=============

* You need at least Java 8 which is [being widely adopted by the Scala community](http://www.infoq.com/news/2014/12/Typesafe-surveys-Java-Adoption)
* clone [this project](https://github.com/stample/rww-play) 
* run
```bash
 $ git clone git://github.com/read-write-web/rww-play.git 
``` 


### Running in single user mode

To start Play in secure mode with lightweight client certificate verification (for WebID); that is, a self-signed certificate:

```bash
 $ ./activator
 [RWWeb] $ idea with-sources=yes	// if you want to run intelliJ
 [RWWeb] $ eclipse with-source=true	// if you want to run eclipse Scala IDE
 [RWWeb] $ compile
 [RWWeb] $ run -Dhttps.port=8443 -Dhttps.trustStore=noCA -Dakka.loglevel=DEBUG -Dakka.debug.receive=on -Drww.root.container.path=test_www 
 ```
Then you can direct your browser to:
[https://localhost:8443/2013/](https://localhost:8443/2013/)


### Running with multiple users securely

If you want to have multiple users on your server, it is best to give each user a subdomain for JS security.
This will protect his space and his javascript from potentially dangerous javascript code uploaded by others.

#### network config

To start Play in secure mode with lightweight client certificate verification (for WebID)
In file:
conf/application.conf
set the smtp parameters: host= and user=
of your mail provider server.

On Unix in `/etc/hosts` add host names for the subdomains you will create, e.g. :
```
127.0.0.1 jmv.localhost
127.0.0.1 jmv1.localhost
127.0.0.1 jmv2.localhost
```

Installing RWW apps
===================

(untested in dev branch as of this commit)

The RWW apps are stored in other git repositories.
One can run the script `./install-app.sh` to install or update the RWW apps that we ship with the platform.
Check the script content, it is simply a git clone. ( If installing on a public server make sure the proxy
url is set. )
 
For subdomains on your local machine you will need to edit `/etc/hosts` for each server. For
machines on the web you can just assign all domains to the same ip address.

```bash
[RWWeb] $ run -Dhttps.port=8443 -Dhttps.trustStore=noCA -Drww.subdomains=true -Dhttp.hostname=localhost -Drww.subdomains=true -Dsmtp.password=secret
```

You can the create yourself a subdomain by pointing your browser to the root domain:
[https://localhost:8443/](https://localhost:8443/). This will lead you to the account creation 
page, which will allow you to create subdomains on your server. An e-mail will be sent to 
your e-mail address for verification ( but you will be able to find the link in the logs 
if the e-mail server is not set up).
