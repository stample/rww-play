rww-play 
========

This is an implementation in Play of a number of tools to build a Read-Write-Web server using Play2.x and akka.
It is very early stages at present and it implements sketches of the following

* A [CORS](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) proxy
* An initial implementation of [Linked Data Basic Profile](http://www.w3.org/2012/ldp/wiki/Main_Page)

This currently works in the [TLS branch of the bblfish fork of Play 2.x](https://github.com/bblfish/Play20), which comes with TLS support and a few more patches.

We use [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org/) to verify the build: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/read-write-web/rww-play.png)](http://travis-ci.org/read-write-web/rww-play)



Getting going
-------------


* You need Java 7 at least - the official Oracle JVM or another one based on [the GPLed code](http://openjdk.java.net/): removing the dependency on Oracle's JVM will require [publishing of the GPLed java security libs](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12982595/openjdk-sun-security-libs-on-maven)
* clone [this project](https://github.com/stample/rww-play) 

```bash
 $ git clone git://github.com/stample/rww-play.git 
``` 

In the `rww-play` home directory, run the `build` bash script. It will download a precompiled tuned 
version of play, build the application, and run it. (If there is no remotely downloadable version
it will build it from source in the `Play20` directory.)

```bash
$ ./build
```

To start Play in secure mode with lightweight client certificate verification (for WebID)

```bash
 $ Play20/play
 > idea with-sources=yes // if you want to run intelliJ
 > compile
 > run  -Dhttps.port=8443 -Dhttps.trustStore=noCA
```

_Experimental_: You can also start the server so that it only accepts WebID certificates - which we will currently
assume are those signed by an agent named "CN=WebID,O=âˆ…". This is experimental! The previous solution is recommended.

```bash
 $ Play20/play
 > run  -Dhttps.port=8443 -Dhttps.trustStore=webid.WebIDTrustManager
```
